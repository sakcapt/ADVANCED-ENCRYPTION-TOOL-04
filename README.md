#DESCRIPTION : This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) application for encrypting and decrypting files using AES-256 encryption. It uses the tkinter library for the GUI and the pycryptodome library for cryptographic operations. The encryption process involves padding the input data to ensure it fits AES's block size (16 bytes) and generating a 256-bit key from a user-provided password using the scrypt key derivation function. A random salt and initialization vector (IV) are used to enhance security and prevent predictable encryption results. These are stored alongside the encrypted file for decryption purposes. The application includes functions for file encryption and decryption, which handle reading the file, performing the cryptographic operations, and saving the result. This GUI is designed for simplicity, allowing users to select input files, specify passwords, and choose output file paths via interactive dialogs. It includes buttons to trigger encryption and decryption processes and provides success or error messages using pop-ups. The design ensures data integrity by implementing padding and unpadding for encrypted data and securely regenerates the decryption key using the original salt and password. This tool is a user-friendly solution for protecting sensitive files with robust cryptographic practices.
